<h1> PROLOG: WANDERER'S CREED</h1>
<p> A young man sits at the far end of the tavern, watching other fraternizers busying themselves with gossip, plots and schemes of all sorts. Sitting at the table next to him, three men murmur amongst themselves.</p>
<p>“We oughta do something ‘bout those low down scoundrels who call themselves ‘lords’ and ‘masters’ over us!” one man whispers. </p>
<p> “Yeah,” another man replies angrily.</p>
 <p> “I say we take them out one by one!” a third man chimes in.</p>
<p> “Not yet,” the first man says, “Patience my good man, patience.”</p>
<p> “Hmmph!” the second man snorts.</p>
<p> A pretty young woman approaches the young man in the corner of the tavern with a jug of water. She places the jug softly on the table where the young man is sitting.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” the young man says. </p>
<p>Brushing back a loose curl, the pretty young woman nods. Leaning back, the young man motions for her to sit by him. She sits down and wraps her arm around his shoulders. </p>
<p>“Rough day?” she asks. </p>
<p> “Yeah,” he replies.</p>
<p>He reaches for the water jug and takes a drink. Gently she strokes his cheek and lays her head on his shoulder. </p>
<p> “You think I could finally meet your parents?” she looks up, “We’ve been together for three months now.”</p>
<p> “I don’t know yet. Between a rock and a hard place, it’s difficult to decide what’s worth the risk: either my double-life as a tournament contestant gone masked rebel, or us and the life I once knew,” he hangs his head, “I just don’t know anymore.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” she sighs. </p>
<p> She gets up from the table, turns to him a kiss and walks away. Just then the tavern door swings open! A tall knight storms into the main room with several others close behind.</p>
<p> “Everyone out! By order of Duke Finnian and by the authority of Lord Daugalias XVI, supreme ruler of Zamaria!” the tall knight shouts.</p>
<p>He draws out his sword. Quickly everyone begins pouring out of the tavern, some fretfully, while others; angry and bitter. The young man watches silently as the knights rush into the tavern, not hearing the squall of violent jeering screams of five knights attempting to thrust him from the table. Finally he comes to, and quickly rises from the table, shoving two of the knights to the side. </p>
<p> “I’m going,” he says.</p>
<p> As he makes his way out, a rough looking general barrels past him.</p>
<p> “Move boy!”</p>
<p> The young man peers over his shoulder to see the general take hold of the pretty young woman by the arm. He turns himself towards them in rage.</p>
<p> “Drinks on the house, girl! Now!” the general orders.</p>
<p> “But… but sir, I don’t work here!” she pleads.</p>
<p> “Well you do now!”</p>
<p> Without a word, the general yanks her over the counter, and she nearly falls face first into the back bar. Enraged, the young man clenches his fists and makes his way towards them. He places a firm hand on the pretty young woman’s shoulder, yanking her back. He positions himself between her and the general. Stunned and sore displeased, the general throws his head back.</p>
<p>“WHAT!?? Who do you think you are, peasant!??” the general demands. </p>
<p>Nearly flying off the bar stool, the general charges past the young man, but he doesn’t budge. Then the general reaches out his hand to shove the young man out of the way. Without warning the young man seizes the general’s opposite shoulder and slams him into the floor. The pretty young woman cries in terror as dozens of knights close in on the young man with swords drawn! One of the knights charges for the young man, but full speed. The young man leaps and punches the knight dead in the chin, sending the knight backward to the ground unconscious. </p>
<p>“Come on!” the young man calls to the pretty young woman. </p>
<p> He takes her in his arms and leaps out of the window and dashes over to his horse nearby.</p>
<p> “What happened back there?” she asks.</p>
<p>The young man turns; his heart and feet racing violently. </p>
<p>“I couldn’t let them treat you like that,” he says. </p>
<p>He turns to hear angry murmurs from inside the tavern. Suddenly, a flash of fear sparks in his eyes, he takes her by the hand and mounts his horse. </p>
<p> “C’mon, we gotta get outta here!’ he says, “Yaw!”</p>
<p> Without another word they descend down the cobblestone streets under a dimly lit night sky. They make their way to the forest just beyond the unwalled borders of the sleeping city. What will become of them? Unharnessed fears make laps around his weary and shaken mind as he surmises a more dire fate than could be imagined possible.</p>

<p> We wander, but there is no home. We struggle, not with enemies, but friends, as we search for worth and purpose. That which we seek is never far. In the valley, we stumble. In the chaos, we cave in. In life, we strive. In our hearts...we war, we war for our very existence. An existence whose purpose does not lie in the outward appearance, but deep within the heart. It is a treasure beyond compare, a treasure worth fighting for, a purpose for which one would be willing to die. There is a man, who must stand the test of time, and by the power of El Roi the Master of Creation, he shall prevail. Over the darkness, over the lies, and over the powers that be. Among those who remain selfless, faithful and true to their people, stands Lionel: a family well respected by all… all except for the House of Daugalias and their mighty Order of Scorpius, who would pose an even greater threat to Zamaria’s sovereignty than that which held them captive. They must be willing, no matter what the cost, to fight and defend the Master of Creation’s greatest treasure… the Apple of The Eye.</p>
